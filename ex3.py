# 1. Create a list of rock, paper, scissors in a variable called rps.
# "rps" means rock, paper, scissors
rps = ['rock','paper','scissors']

# 2. Create a variable called user_choice that takes input from the user and stores it.

user_choice = input("rock,paper or scissor")
while user_choice not in ["rock", "paper", "scissors"]:
   user_choice = input("Please enter rock, paper or scissors")

# 3. Create a variable called computer_choice that randomly chooses from rps.
computer_choice = random.choice(rps)

# 4. Print out the user_choice and the computer_choice.
print("You chose: " + user_choice)
print("The computer chose: " + computer_choice)

# 5. Print out the winner of rock, paper, scissors.

if user_choice == computer_choice:
  print("It's a tie!")
